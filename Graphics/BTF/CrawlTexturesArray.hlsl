//Hummm, it may be possible that this file helps for BTF atmospheric scattering.... Too much questions !
//Let s design functions names first ! What is BTF from scratch and what is forbidden by scratch to be used in
//GRF for example ? 
//it seems the response is :  h = …

//then we have : ..... Let me check it !
