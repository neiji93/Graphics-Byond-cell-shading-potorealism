//use the relationship between : 
//1/ E * U^2 <= E * R^2 * I^2
//and 2/ ln(2980*x) = exp(20*y)
//see researches maths fin 2024 repository although I used that in supercomputer cells architexture
//it helps to crawl rapidely BTF material textures
//Maybe we can use RK4 twice here like I did for another function in another type of scattering function.
//Hummm, it may be possible that this file helps for BTF atmospheric scattering.... Too much questions !
//Let s design functions names first ! What is BTF from scratch and what is forbidden by scratch to be used in
//GRF for example ? 
//it seems the response is :  h = …
// nombrePremier * Pi = cos( …)    ou nombrePremier * Pi = tan(…..)   No ! No ! we have to mdofiy it in physics !
//then we have : ..... Let me check it ! 
//see again : see researches maths fin 2024
//Hopefully, I did researches in maths but it was not really obvious to use my researches in the supercomputer
