//If we succeed to create flickering, it will be possible to extend the 
//maintained time along the model to check. As we previously worked on futur_preview and
//got 3 conductors, it seems, according to chemistry, that there are orders that govern water molecular
//properies. Then, turning it into physics, a great scale energy can ....
To prove it, we may be able to use colliding atoms of liquid metals. We already know that the pathway will
//be 0 or -1. Then, do we have to use spins ?
//As we also worked on high numbers of terms in functions for physics of futur_preview, we can now redo that.
//So, the problem now is log(x) that we can keep or delete from our futur equation or function. As we have 
//a large formula, we can keep it as a constant. Then, it means our validation model can....
