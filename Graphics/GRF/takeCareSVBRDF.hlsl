//as we succeed SVBRDF, we can keep track of GRF !
//so, what we can do from scratch ? Maybe there are some ways ! Let's take my old or recent other repositories !
//Coming soon !
//At the moment, we can reject all formulas we saw in mathematics in our life and produce some things !
//I mean old approximate solutions until today ! I mean one complete approximate solution and only one !
//My nephew Edis Louis Rasulov succeeded to produce something for himself ! Let's ask him !
//Before that moment, I will search for nowadaays mathematical research areas and transform the statements
//to apply in physics ! Let's try an old colleague at CNRS-LIPN chao bau Ngo !
//I will look at extending the areas of his researches ! It seems that he doesn't share so much things.
//So, what is he hidding ? What am I hidding ? So I choose this totally absurd sentence :
//"Formes automorphes continues sur un espace vectorielle à 11 dimensions (matrix model) et
//series génératrices associées". I studied generative series at college. Sorry, this is totally stupid
//and from scratch but we can again create non weapon functions here ! Maybe it can help in other
//areas of researches !

//Let's try to start. Notice that I don't use transluciency and transparency !
