//As mentionned in ultraviolet folder, we can have compositing in the ultraviolet project.
//So, what about compositing here ? Accelerating renderer ? As our compositing functions
//use sometimes suites, and as we used heat mechanisms, we have to create a new formula or model
//or anything else and look if this is suited for BRF compositing ! We won't have to use physical h here
//because we won't have to fall into models everytime ! Maybe I'm wrong in physics field here ! Let's ee what happen !
