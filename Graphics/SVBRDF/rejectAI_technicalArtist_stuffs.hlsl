//As we used some kind of c code in BTF folder and as SVBRDF was found by AI,
//there must some ways to reject AI which used no modal prototyping of graphics.
//This seems to be a mix between super energy and high dimensional behaviours of elements.
//That said, if we succeed to produce a c like code here, we can find a code that is not the same
//event that occured in the past. Plus, technical arrtists stuffs are likely patching if I'm not wrong.
//Then, super energy can be a growing field like finding some things in mathematics and translate them
//to physics. This was done by .... (a guy who received a trophy - the first trophy for translating physics
to maths). Finally, it means that, in fact, we won't need technical artist stuff in this folder !
