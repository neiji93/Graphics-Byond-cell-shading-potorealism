//I had difficulties to switch from physics to mathematics after the last repository futur preview.
//It means that mathematical corpuses here hardly switch from differential functions to other differential
//functions ! That is the first point.

//in CG, differential functions can be described with BSDF but as BSDF (not itself) is hard for realtime rendering,
//it is best to use mathematical corpus formulas. The great tool will be then to have a point light !
//more to come.
