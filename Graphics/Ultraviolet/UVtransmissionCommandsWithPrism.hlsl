//we already set transmission for GRF. Now, we can create transmission for ultraviolet (from scratch).
//As my repository prism is not a weapon too, it has the advantages of separating scene into tiles like a rendering technique.
//So, do we have to use an algorithm instead of having pure functions ? As I said, UV is not visible, so we can take
//the transmission formulas as complete copies here because the previous formulas in GRF transmission don't have any momentum terms !
//It means that Runge kutta 4 RK4 method is not suited here, then it means that the source code wont be too long. In physics,
//having short formulas can be expressed in heat transfer if I'm not wrong (from scratch) ! Then, the only thing that we have to do is
//to add some or one other formula or model ! Let me thing aabout it ! hummmm....Coming soon.
//This is wonderfull because this approximate nothing here even it may be not secure !
